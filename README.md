# Real World Testing with Cypress - Course App

This project serves as the practical component for the "Testing your first application" course hosted on learn.cypress.io. It provides a real-world application to apply the testing concepts learned during the course.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to facilitate hands-on learning and practice of testing methodologies using Cypress. By providing a real-world application, participants can gain practical experience in writing tests for common scenarios encountered in web development.

### Components
- ##### _Real World App:_ 
The application itself represents a real-world web application, which participants will test throughout the course. It may include various features and functionalities commonly found in web development projects.
- ##### _Tests:_
The tests are created using Cypress and are designed to validate different aspects of the application's functionality. These tests cover scenarios such as user interactions, form submissions, navigation, and more.
